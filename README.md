# Chef Navigator

This is a Google Chrome plugin that makes it easier to navigate Chef repos on github by turning role and recipe references into actual links.  
To set it up: clone the repo, go to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome, check 'Developer mode', click Load unpacked extension and locate the cloned folder.
